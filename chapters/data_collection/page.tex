{\large \textbf{Methods for Gaining an Understanding}}\\
Gather stories from stakeholders - examples of their work, struggles, processes, etc.

\subsection*{Interviews}
Structered interview, with predetermined order and questions.\\
Semi-structured, loose understanding of questions, but more so followint the flow of conversations.\\
Unstructured, loose understanding of questions, but more focused understanding general concern of customer.

\subsection*{Contextual Inquiry}
Understand the actual work they are doing. Understanding their expertise of their needs and work. Abstraction, find communalities and describe for the general user, not just the individual interviewed. Find the right granularity of the interview and understanding to not loose focus or getting overdetailed in descriptions.

\subsection*{Quantifiable data}
Usually a questionaires. These can be first implemented into the development team to test, before sending to a customer. Keep it short.Preferably use a validated questions. Allows for comparing mulitiple users experience and wants for the potential system. Questionaires can be found on pages like Google Scholar.

\subsection*{Cultural Propes}
Gather information in a given activity, by letting user do activity without the designer being present. Where the user collects the data in their home or workplace. This allows the user to collect important information for them, whereas the design would have to guess.

\subsection*{Field Observations}
It's difficult for users to express all details in interviews and surveys. Using field observations, common behaviour that is not thought about like keyboard shortcut can be found. Usually done after interview to know what to look for. Being unobtrusive is important as to not distract or impeding them.
